## Logistic regressions

**Logistic regression:** a specialized form of regression that is formulated to predict and explain a binary (two-group) categorical variable rather than a metric dependent measure. May be described as estimating the relationship between a single-non-metric binary dependent variable and a set of metric or non-metric independent variables:

**Classification matrix:** means of assessing the predictive ability of the logistic regression model. Created by cross-tabulating actual values with predicted values. Shows incorrect and correct classifications.

**Cross-validation:** Procedure of dividing the data
in two parts. Avoids over fitting.

-   *Analysis sample:* Used in estimating the logistic regression model

-   *Holdout sample* (validation sample): Used to validate the results

**Hit ratio:** Percentage of objects correctly
classified by the model.

-   TP + TN / N

-   True Positive + True Negative / Number of observations

*Two types of the logistics coefficient:*

**Logistic coefficient: (original).** A positive relationship means that an increase in independent variable is associated with an increase in the predicted probability.

-   A negative value implies a decrease in the predicted probability

-   A positive values implies a increase of the predicted probability

-   Value 0.0 means a probability of 50%.

**Exponentiated logistic regression:** stated in terms of odds. There won't be negative values.

-   Coefficient -1.0 = percentage change in the odds

-   F.e. Coefficient of 0.20 = a negative 80 percent change in the odds --\> 0.20-1.0 = -0.80 for each unit change in the independent variable

-   A value of 1.0 means there is no change in the odds. The odds are 50% to predict either group. There is a relationship with no direction.

-   A value above 1.0 means a positive increase in the predicted odds

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Assessing magnitude of change:**

**Percentage change in odds =** (Exponentiated coefficient - 1.0) * 100

**Logistic curve:** represent the probability of an event.

**Logit transformation:** transforms values into a discrete binary dependent variable --> probability of an event. This probability is transformed into the odds ratio which acts as the depend variable.

**Maximum chance criteria (MCC) =** Measure of predictive accuracy that is calculated as the percentage of respondents in the largest group.

    - N largest group / total number of observation. 
    - If your hit rate is larger than this, you are having some value.

**Odds:** the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of the event not happening. Used as the dependent variable.

**Model estimation fit:**

**Likelihood value:** the lower the -2LL, the better for of the model. Perfect fit is 0.

Pseudo R^2 measures: values from 0.0-1.0. Cox & Snell R^2 = the higher value, a greater model fit. The amount of variation accounted for by the model. 1.0 is a perfect fit model.

### Sensitivity vs Specificity

Sensitivity = TP / TP + FN, second number\
Specificity = TN / FP + TN\
Hit rate = TP + TN / N\
True positive rate = TP / TP + FN\
Actual negative = TN / TN + FP

**Validation of the results:**

Establishing external validity is done through assessment of hit ratios through a separate holdout sample. It is supported when the hit ratio of the selected approach exceeds the comparison standards that represent the predictive accuracy expected by chance.
