# Preface {.unnumbered}

The following document has been prepared to have a prompt link to the code learned and used throughout several projects in the last year. As a beginner in programming, it is always useful to have input accessible to avoid having to look through numerous repositories.

The **bookdown** package that has been used for this format can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

To compile this example to PDF, you will need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
